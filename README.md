This mod contains a lot of skills, mechanics, and other helpful things that were originally made for the Sonic The Hedgehog mod but I felt could be useful for more things. I encourage anyone to use this mod with their own project if they can find any use in it.

This project has the Chaos Emeralds and Super forms from Sonic The Hedgehog. The Super form transformation is built off a system designed to make it possible to make your own transformations which can be usable by any survivors you want.

This project contains the base for making a new skill similar to Sonic's boost, including the entity states and the component for handling the boost meter.

Launching is a new mechanic that lets you turn an enemy into a projectile that will fly into enemies and deal damage. This is primarily activated via a modded damage type which automatically decides most of the launch's stats (damage, range, direction, etc.) but launches can be called directly for more control.
